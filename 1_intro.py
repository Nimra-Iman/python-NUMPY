# Numpy has arrays and we use numpy arrays instead of lists because lists processing is 
#  are very slow espacially when we have large dataset. Numpy arrays are 50X faster as
# compared to lists.
# python lists k jitny elements hn, hr element memory m alag jga le ga and also it is
# non-contagious memory locations, but arrays are placed in contagious memory locations.
# NUMPY mostly written in python but for some fast compututation, some part is written
#  C and C++
